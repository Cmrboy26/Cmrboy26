# Hi, I'm Colten!

I'm a first-year Software Engineering student at MSOE who strives to live a life of learning. In my time outside of studying and school work, I design and develop various types of projects. In the past, I've programmed a full-stack web application with a relational database, a completed game networked using a server-client model, and a state-qualifying robot for FIRST Tech Challenge with autonomous capabilities. (You can view all these projects and more in my pinned repositories below).
  
## What am I up to?

- Working and studying hard at MSOE.
- Designing a modular JWT authentication Spring Boot library accessable through a RESTful API.
- Developing an online multiplayer 4X game revolving around alchemy, chemistry, and combat using LibGDX and structured with an entity-component system.
- Participating in Game Development Club, Society of Software Engineers, and MSOE's AI club, MAIC.
- Learning and applying chemistry concepts at my home laboratory.

## Past Activities and Achievements

- Qualified for Wisconsin state FTC competition first year team of two programmers
- Taught two Java coding classes over two summers to get underclassmen interested in programming and robotics.
- Completed my first polished video game, Project Tetra TD, a scalable multiplayer tower defense game.

## Fun Facts

- My personal website/portfolio, coltenreissmann.me, is hosted on my own dedicated Linux server. (Our network has been experiencing issues, which is incredibly unfortunate, but I'm working on fixing it).
- I enjoy the problem-solving associated with classes like calculus and physics 
- I love playing and developing video games in my free time.
- When I feel inspired, I enjoy composing and producing music.
- 8-bit music is my favorite genre of music.
- I have been playing the trombone since I was in 5th grade.
