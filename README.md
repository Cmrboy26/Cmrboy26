# Hi, I'm Colten!

- I'm a high schooler with a deep interest in programming and computer science
- Java is my go-to language and some of my secondaries are (from most to least frequent) C#, HTML, CSS, C++, Python, and Lua

## History

- My interest in programming stemmed from Roblox (yeah yeah, I know) in 2017 and Minecraft mods around 2018 
- I self-taught myself Java in ~2019 (about 5 years ago!) and have been programming ever since

## Fun Facts

- My favorite subject in school is math (calculus = best class)
- Cats are OBJECTIVELY the best pet
- I love playing (and making) video games in my free time
- I enjoy composing and producing music when I feel inspired
- Retro/Chiptune/8-bit music is my favorite style of music
- I have been playing the trombone since I was in 5th grade (first chair first part in concert and jazz band ðŸ˜Ž)

## What am I up to?

- I'm currently working on a 2D video game titled Gaze
- I'm programming a robot for the FTC CenterStage challenge
- I'm working on staying up-to-date with school
